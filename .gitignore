# downloads/*.json

# Otherwise, if they are always temporary outputs, the current broad rule is okay.
# For now, I'll keep them broad as per your original intent, but add a note.
*.json # Be careful: this ignores all JSON files, including potential config.
*.html # Be careful: this ignores all HTML files, including potential templates.

# If 'testing_script/' contains temporary or scratch scripts not meant for the repo:
